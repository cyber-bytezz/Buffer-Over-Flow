![Buffer Overflow Exploit](https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/Buffer-Over-Flow/assets/130319315/1c629f8b-a501-49a8-88f8-0cad8070b28a)


## Overview 📝

This Python script demonstrates a buffer overflow exploit using a "TRUN" command against a vulnerable target system. It exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability to gain control of the target system and execute arbitrary code.

## Key Features ✨

- Buffer overflow exploit implementation
- Customizable payload generation
- Socket-based communication with the target system

## Usage 🚀

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/buffer-overflow-exploit.git`
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Customize the target IP address and port in the `connect()` method of the script.
5. Run the script: `python exploit.py`
6. Observe the script's output for successful exploitation.

## Sample Output 🎯

```
Buffer overflow exploit successful! ✅
```
